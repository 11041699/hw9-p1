                        <h2>Trust</h2>
                        <p>Blockchain creates trust between different entities where trust is either nonexistent or unproven. As a result, these entities are willing to engage in business dealings that involve transactions or data sharing that they may not have otherwise done or would have required an intermediary to do so. The enablement of trust is one blockchain's most cited benefits. Its value is evident in early blockchain use cases that facilitated transactions among entities that didn't have direct relationships yet still had to share data or payments. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are quintessential examples of how blockchain enables trust between participants who don't know each other.</p>

                        <h2>Decentralized structure</h2>
                        <p>Blockchain really proves its value when there's no central actor who enables trust, explained Daniel Field, head of blockchain at UST, a global provider of digital technology and services. So, in addition to enabling trust when participants lack trust because they're unknown to each other, blockchain enables sharing of data within an ecosystem of businesses where no single entity is exclusively in charge. Supply chain is a case in point: Multiple businesses -- from suppliers and transportation companies to producers, distributors and retailers -- want or need information from others in that chain, yet no one is in charge of facilitating all that information sharing. Blockchain, with its decentralized nature, solves for that dilemma.</p>

                        <h2>Improved security</h2>
                        <p>The security of blockchain-enabled systems is another leading benefit of this emerging technology. The enhanced security offered by blockchain stems from how the technology actually works: Blockchain creates an unalterable record of transactions with end-to-end encryption, which shuts out fraud and unauthorized activity. Additionally, data on the blockchain is stored across a network of computers, making it nearly impossible to hack (unlike conventional computer systems that store data together in servers). Furthermore, blockchain can address privacy concerns better than traditional computer systems by anonymizing data and requiring permissions to limit access</p>

                <p>PayPal had these goals of creating a new currency. We failed at that, and we just created a new payment system. I think Bitcoin has succeeded on the level of a new currency, but the payment system is somewhat lacking. It’s very hard to use, and that’s the big challenge on the Bitcoin side.</p>
